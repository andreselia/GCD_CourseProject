# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The main goal is to tidy a data set and perform a simple analysis. Briefly, the data is downloaded and unziped in the working directory. The files containing the data are merged into one data set. The index activities are changed for his descriptive names, and features are modified to get appropriately labels with a more descriptive name. Finally, the mean and standard deviation for each measurement is extracted and the average of each activity and each subject is performed and stored in the dataset_avg.txt file.

**The R script is provided in the file named run_analysis.R**

*Further details about the origin of the data, variables and modifications can be found in the codebook. *
